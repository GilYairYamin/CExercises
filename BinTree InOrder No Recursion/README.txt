An implementation of inorder traversal on a binary tree without recursion.
binTree.c:
Has implementation of tree nodes and a creation of a binary tree for testing.
Also has the function itself called inorder traversal.

nodeStack.c:
Has implementation for a stack which its values are binray tree nodes, used in the algorithm.

main.c:
Has a main function, and basic calls for he rest of the functions to test the result.
